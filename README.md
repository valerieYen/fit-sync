Project README

Overview

This project is a multi-tab web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The application consists of six tabs, each with unique functionality and design elements. The goal is to create an interactive and visually appealing user experience by leveraging fundamental web technologies.

Technologies Used

HTML: Structure and layout of the application

CSS: Styling and positioning elements

JavaScript: Handling interactivity and dynamic content updates

Tab 1: "Text"

Contains a long page of text with a scrollbar.

Only the text has a scrollbar; the navigation bar remains static.

Tab 2: "LR"

Displays the text "Down Here" positioned in the lower right corner of the content area.

Tab 3: "Colors"

Displays two lines of text with the following styling:

Yellow text on a black background

Purple text on a yellow background

Tab 4: "Profile"

Displays a centered image with a bold name centered below it.

Clicking the image triggers a notification pop-up, which can be dismissed by the user.

Tab 5: "Choices"

Includes:

A radio button selection option.

A drop-down list selection option.

A button that, when clicked, displays text reflecting the chosen options.

Tab 6: "ToDo"

Implements a basic To-Do list allowing users to:

Add new items.

Delete items.

"Cross off" completed tasks in a meaningful way.
